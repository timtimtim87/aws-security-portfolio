# SecureTech Corp - AWS Multi-Account Security Architecture

## 🏢 Project Overview

**Scenario**: SecureTech Corp is transitioning from a single AWS account to a secure, governed multi-account environment to support their growing software business.

**Objective**: Implement enterprise-grade AWS security architecture with full governance controls, centralized monitoring, and compliance automation.

## 🎯 Business Requirements

- ✅ Separate development and production environments
- ✅ Centralized security monitoring and logging
- ✅ Developer access controls with appropriate permissions
- ✅ Audit compliance and automated governance
- ✅ Cost control and resource management
- ✅ Prevention of accidental resource deletion

## 🏗️ Target Architecture

### Account Structure
```
SecureTech-Root (Management)
├── Security OU
│   ├── Security-Audit Account (Centralized Logging)
│   └── Log-Archive Account (Control Tower)
├── Production OU
│   └── Production-Workloads Account
└── Development OU
    ├── Dev-Environment Account
    └── Sandbox Account
```

### Security Controls Framework
- **Identity**: Root user MFA, Cross-account roles, SAML federation
- **Access Control**: Service Control Policies, IAM policies, Least privilege
- **Resource Protection**: Resource tagging, Encryption, Network isolation
- **Monitoring**: CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config rules
- **Compliance**: Automated remediation, Compliance reporting, Audit trails
